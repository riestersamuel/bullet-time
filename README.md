# BulletTime - A short description
We are building a minimalistic yet super effective digital app for bullet journaling. It's supposed to be a note-taking app which focuses on the integration of simple but powerful productivity methods like the "plan for today", the "daily highlight" or the "pomodoro timer". It also supports simple note taking with image support.

## Categories
We used data storage and media (in the form of adding photos from the library), as well as some animations.

# Installation
Since this app isn't (yet) in the Google Playstore, you'll need to install it through Android Studio. Therefore, you need to connect your smartphone (via cable) with your computer and then run the app on the connected device. Make sure the developers mode is activated.
